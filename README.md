## Overview

### Guidelines

The project must satisfy the following requirements:

- It must include a textbox that allows the user to search information about a city, calling the [Teleport API](https://developers.teleport.org/api/reference/#/)
- Once the response is received, the page must show the information about each category, the city summary and its total score

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 custom properties
- Mobile first development
- Flexbox
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Axios
- Lodash
- Webpack 5

### What I learned

I learned how to build a little webapp that handles the response from a third-party API, and that not everything will work as expected: I implemented Axios and Lodash that taught me how to handle those scenarios.

### Continued development

I'll surely look up to this one when I'll develop similar projects, I think that handling the data that comes from an API is a  common task we should be able to do

### Useful resources

- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/guides/): this guide helped me set up the Webpack application without struggling too much
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): a guide that explains how to utilize this JavaScript package to make API calls alternatively to XMLHttpRequest and Fetch
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15): the documentation of this JavaScript library comes in handing when handling objects and arrays. Especially, I made use of the [get](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#get) method
- [ResponsivelyApp](https://responsively.app/): a developer browser that makes it easier to see how an application behaves on different devices
- [FontSpace](https://www.fontspace.com/category/uppercase): a site where I found the font I used
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/): a site of SVG illustrations where I got my background image
- [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/): the site where the icons I used come from
